It is official, dual booting is now dead – Boot from VHD is the new king.

On my flight to [BoS2009](http://www.businessofsoftware.org/), I was inadvertently reliving some nostalgic milestones from the past 10 nay 20 years.

I had my Windows 7 laptop, booted from a VHD (see [Scott’s great post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/default.aspx?date=2009-05-21) for some easy instructions on how to configure this) – the OS I had booted into was Windows 2008, I had installed the Hyper-V role and was running an install of Windows XP on a virtual machine at the same time was running a command line install of Exchange 2007.

If only I had brought my Windows 3.1 diskettes with me I’d have had a straight flush…. here’s how it looked…
